"""
Small shared subprocess helpers. run_ok() is a quiet "did this
succeed" check (used by detection and post-install verification);
run_privileged() is for commands that need root (package install,
usermod, systemctl) and deliberately does NOT capture output - sudo's
password prompt and an install script's own progress need to reach
the real terminal, unlike every quiet check in detect.py.

run_streaming() is the live-progress variant: when a stream sink is
set (see set_stream_sink()), run_privileged() and run_docker_command()
tee each output line to that sink (a Rich Live panel in the CLI front
end) instead of the terminal, while still returning the exact same
result shapes their plain forms do - so every caller keeps working
unchanged whether or not a progress panel is active.
