Checks run once, right before the very first `docker compose up -d`
for a generated stack - distinct from docker_setup.py (is Docker
itself ready) and post_install.py (operations on an already-running-
or-runnable stack). check_ports_available() reads the already-written
compose file back and confirms every host port it publishes is
actually free, so a real conflict (something else already bound to
that port) gets reported clearly before Docker's own opaque failure,
not after.
